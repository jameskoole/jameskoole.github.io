## Product Manager
I’m currently a Product Manager for a leading retail domain name registrar.

Since 2014, I’ve led a team of developers and designers through constant iteration to improve the experience for our customers, whether they are Internet experts or new to the web.

### My approach
I’m passionate about product and relish the opportunity to improve and add features to any product through an iterative and methodical approach that makes a measurable difference to users while not upsetting the apple cart through radical change.

Users don’t like change, so completely remaking a product without alienating and upsetting those users is a significant challenge. By maintaining consistency and familiarity even when completely swapping out pages and tools, users were brought from old to new over time in a far less disruptive way.
