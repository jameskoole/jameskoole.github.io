# Running Goals for 2021

2021 is rapidly approaching, and as I ramp up my running again here in late 2020, I decided to formalize some goals for 2021 as it relates to running.

These are pretty random and not especially interesting to anyone besides me, but putting them on "paper" will make them real.

## Goals

1. Run more in 2021 than any previous year (2,431.2km)
2. Get my [Strava Fitness and Freshness](Strava Fitness and Freshness) score to 90.
3. Run 50km in a single run, preferably on my 50th birthday.
4. Become a "dailymiler" and run every single day.
5. Revive my running blog.

These are related goals, obviously. If I run everyday, chances are I will get close to that mileage total without too much trouble. The Strava Fitness and Freshness score will likely come along for the ride as well. My previous high was 83 at the peak of the running of the Great Virtual Race Across Tennessee in 2020. As of November 11, 2020, I have a 32 score.

As for the 50km run goal, it's something I've been thinking about for a few years now. I ran 42.2km on my 40th birthday in Vancouver, B.C. back in 2011, and the idea of running 50km on my 50th birthday seems like a great goal. I've run 50km twice already, so I know I can do it. The question is whether I can be ready to do it by May. If not, I'll settle for some other point in the year.
